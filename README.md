# Check-m8
This is my app named Check m8. This is an app that will (hopefully) allow a user to tackle the issue of food dining experiences in a post-Covid world.


Hello Professor, just wanted to add a readme file to clarify a couple of things. Similar to how my final exam went, I've had a lot of personal troubles leading up to the final
days of class. Now for the final that's a more fair excuse I guess, but for Assignment 4 I just sort of fell apart.

Firstly, using an architechture from Google Cloud's framework ended up becoming a complete disaster towards the end of the development for my app.
Possibly because I was using Swift as my language, I tried countless ways to incorporate Google Maps into my restaurant based app where the user could navigate to 
where their food would be held for pick up or even implementing delivery features. It was very difficult finding help while using the Swift language online. Regardless,
it is my fault for not preparing enough and procrastinating to let it come to this point of disaster. So, I apologize for my subpar work Professor.

I was not able to record a demo of the app because I could barely get the "grabbing" of the user's location and using Google's Cloud Framework to work. I also could not create a 
white or blackbox test scenario that was required of this assignment.

What I could provide was a git repo link of what I was able to muster up without breaking anything else. I apologize for the terrible work once again Professor.

Also, to avoid any type plagiarism I will provide the link to the youtube video that helped me code some of the userLocation work.

Thank you for the great semester Professor. I honestly did learn a lot, but I just wasn't able to apply in the last sprint of the semester. Take care.
